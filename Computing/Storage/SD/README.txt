All SD cards (short for Secure Digital), regardless of their size, use one or two small NAND flash memory chips – similar to those found in USB memory sticks and SSDs – and a tiny processor to manage the flow of data and instructions.

There are 3 standards for the dimensions, and they are incompatible with each other. In other words, a miniSD card reader won't work with microSD cards (unless you use an adapter):

Standard SD cards: 1.26 x 0.94 x 0.083 to 0.055 inches (32 x 24 x 2.1-1.4 mm)
miniSD cards: 0.85 x 0.79 x 0.055 inches (21.5 x 20 x 1.4 mm)
microSD cards: 0.56 x 0.43 x 0.039 inches (15 x 11 x 1 mm)S
